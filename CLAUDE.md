# AI Browser — baseline working version

**Status: this version works. It builds from scratch with zero errors and is a good starting
point.** New functionality gets built on top of it. When changing anything, preserve the
invariants listed under [Things that break silently](#things-that-break-silently) — those are
the ones that produce no compile error and only show up at runtime as a blank panel or missing
icons.

The extension is a fork of `simple-browser` from the microsoft/vscode monorepo, extracted into
a standalone project and renamed. Every tie to the monorepo (gulp, shared esbuild helpers,
`../../node_modules`) has been removed.

Published as `DenysDavydov.ai-browser`.

## How we build features — the main approach

**New browser functionality is built against VS Code's built-in browser, through the `browser`
API proposal and CDP. This is the default and it is settled** — the recipe is in
[The `browser` proposed API](#the-browser-proposed-api--the-main-way-to-add-features). It is
proven, not theoretical: the element picker ([src/elementPicker.ts](src/elementPicker.ts))
works this way end to end.

**Do not add features to the webview panel.** It remains available
(`aiBrowser.useIntegratedBrowser: false`) and bug fixes there are fine, but new work does not
go there. The panel is a webview hosting a cross-origin iframe, and that costs it — by
construction, with no workaround — clipboard and undo shortcuts inside the page, every
keyboard shortcut while the page has focus, find in page, site permissions, storage control,
real per-page DevTools, page zoom, and any history beyond what was typed in the address bar.
Each of those is a CDP call away in the built-in browser.

This was worked out the long way. **Do not re-derive these dead ends:**

- Extensions cannot contribute to the built-in browser's toolbar or its "..." overflow menu.
  The `contributes.menus` allowlist has 96 keys and not one maps to a `Browser*` `MenuId`, and
  no API proposal covers it. `editor/title` does work — that is where the element picker's
  button lives.
- Nothing can forward keyboard input out of a cross-origin iframe. VS Code's own answer is a
  preload script plus main-process IPC; extensions have neither.
- A page can hand its keys back by including a snippet we provide, and that does work, but it
  only ever applies to pages you control, so it is not a general answer.

## Conventions

**All documentation, code comments, README, and commit messages are written in English.**

**Every quirk, special case, unusual decision, and piece of "this is how it has to be done for
it to work" knowledge must be written down in this file, in the
[Special cases and non-obvious decisions](#special-cases-and-non-obvious-decisions) section.**
That applies to anything that cost time to figure out, anything that looks wrong but is
deliberate, and anything a reasonable change would break. If it was surprising once, it will be
surprising again — record it instead of rediscovering it. Runtime failure modes with no compile
error go under [Things that break silently](#things-that-break-silently) instead; deliberate
removals go under [Removed on purpose](#removed-on-purpose--do-not-reintroduce).

## What it does

Displays a web page in an iframe inside a VS Code webview panel, with its own address bar and
navigation controls.

There are three entry points. All three first check whether the `workbench.action.browser.open`
command exists (VS Code's built-in browser) and delegate to it instead of opening our own panel
— see `shouldUseIntegratedBrowser` in [src/extension.ts](src/extension.ts):

| Entry point | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `aiBrowser.show` | Command palette entry — "AI Browser: Show"; prompts for a URL if none is passed |
| `aiBrowser.api.open` | Programmatic API for **other extensions** — the fork's primary purpose |
| External URI opener `aiBrowser.open` | Intercepts `http`/`https`, but only for localhost-like hosts |

The external URI opener does not fire for arbitrary URLs — only for the hosts listed in
`enabledHosts` (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `0.0.0.0` and the IPv6 equivalents). For anything
else it returns `ExternalUriOpenerPriority.None`, so VS Code opens the system browser.

Settings: `aiBrowser.useIntegratedBrowser` (**default `true`**), `aiBrowser.focusLockIndicator.enabled`
(delegate to VS Code's built-in browser instead of our panel — **off by default**, see
[Special cases](#special-cases-and-non-obvious-decisions)) and `aiBrowser.searchEngine`.

## Architecture: two independent halves

This is the key thing to understand about the build. The code lives in two isolated runtimes,
each with its own compilation step.

### 1. Extension host (Node.js) — `src/` → `out/`

Compiled with `tsc`, **no bundling**. `main: ./out/extension`.

- [src/extension.ts](src/extension.ts) — `activate`, command and opener registration
- [src/aiBrowserManager.ts](src/aiBrowserManager.ts) — singleton holder for the active panel
- [src/aiBrowserView.ts](src/aiBrowserView.ts) — the panel: HTML generation, message bridge
- [src/dispose.ts](src/dispose.ts) — base `Disposable` with `_register`
- [src/uuid.ts](src/uuid.ts) — nonce generator, copied from `vs/base/common/uuid`
- [src/cdp.ts](src/cdp.ts) — CDP client for the built-in browser (not used by the panel)
- [src/elementPicker.ts](src/elementPicker.ts) — the three element commands
- [src/elementContext.ts](src/elementContext.ts) — pulls element data out of the page over CDP
- [src/elementMarkdown.ts](src/elementMarkdown.ts) — renders that data as Markdown
- [src/cssHelpers.ts](src/cssHelpers.ts) — copied verbatim from vscode, builds the CSS section
- [src/toolsView.ts](src/toolsView.ts) — the activity bar panel

**There is only ever one panel.** `AIBrowserManager._activeView` is a single slot: a repeat
`show()` reuses the existing panel rather than creating a second one. If multiple tabs are ever
needed, that is the place to change.

The panel is created with `retainContextWhenHidden: true` (the iframe is not reloaded when
switching tabs) and `localResourceRoots: [<ext>/media]` — **`media/` only**; the webview cannot
load resources from any other directory.

### 2. Webview (browser sandbox) — `preview-src/` → `media/`

Bundled with `esbuild`. This is the script running **inside** the panel: address bar,
back/forward/reload, "open externally" button, focus lock indicator.

- [preview-src/index.ts](preview-src/index.ts) → `media/index.js`
- [preview-src/events.ts](preview-src/events.ts) — `onceDocumentLoaded`
- `@vscode/codicons/dist/codicon.css` → `media/codicon.css`

`media/main.css` and `media/icon.png` are checked-in static assets and are not built.
`media/index.js`, `media/codicon.css` and their `.map` files are **build artifacts and are
gitignored**. After a fresh clone the panel stays blank until `npm run compile` has run.

CSS classes the webview script depends on: `.header`, `.controls`, `.url-input`,
`.back-button`, `.forward-button`, `.reload-button`, `.open-external-button`, `.content`,
`.iframe-focused-alert`, plus these toggled on `body`: `iframe-focused`,
`enable-focus-lock-indicator`.

### The bridge between the halves

Initial state is handed over **through the DOM, not through a message**: the extension writes
JSON into `<meta id="ai-browser-settings" data-settings="...">` and the webview reads it in
`getSettings()`. The `ai-browser-settings` identifier is hard-coded in two files — rename it in
both, or the webview throws `Could not load settings` and the panel stays blank.

Messages:

| Direction | Message |
|---|---|
| webview → extension | `{ type: 'openExternal', url }` → `vscode.env.openExternal` |
| extension → webview | `{ type: 'didChangeFocusLockIndicatorEnabled', focusLockEnabled }` |

Panel state for restoring across restarts: the webview calls `vscode.setState({ url })` and the
extension registers a `WebviewPanelSerializer` for `viewType = 'aiBrowser.view'`.

**Dead code:** the webview handles a `{ type: 'focus' }` message that the extension never
sends — a leftover from the monorepo. Either wire it up or delete it.

## Panel CSP — the main constraint when extending

The HTML is generated in `AIBrowserView.getHtml()`. Its Content-Security-Policy is strict:

```
default-src 'none';
font-src data:;
style-src ${webview.cspSource};
script-src 'nonce-${nonce}';
frame-src *;
```

What that implies for new functionality:

- **Every `<script>` must carry `nonce="${nonce}"`.** The nonce is regenerated on each
  `getHtml()` call. A script without it is silently blocked.
- **Fonts may only be `data:` URIs.** A separate font file next to the CSS will not load. This
  is exactly why `codicon.ttf` is inlined into `codicon.css` (see below).
- **`img-src` is not allowed at all** (`default-src 'none'`). Displaying images in the panel
  requires adding the directive.
- **No `fetch`/XHR from the panel** — `connect-src` is not allowed. Data has to travel through
  `postMessage` to the extension host.
- The iframe is created with `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-forms allow-same-origin allow-downloads"`.

`navigateTo()` in the webview appends `id` and `vscodeBrowserReqId` query parameters to the
URL. That is a cache-busting hack — it was the only reliable way found to force the iframe to
reload.

## Build

There are **no production dependencies at all**, only devDependencies. All seven are in use —
verified by removing each one from `node_modules` and watching what broke.

```
compile                  build-ext && build-webview            ← full build
watch                    run-p -l watch-ext watch-webview watch-typecheck-webview
build-ext                tsc --project ./tsconfig.json         ← src/ → out/
build-webview            node ./esbuild.webview.mts            ← preview-src/ → media/
watch-ext                tsc ... --watch

```

To verify a change:

```sh
rm -rf out media/index.js media/index.js.map media/codicon.css media/codicon.css.map
npm run compile && npm run typecheck
```

### TypeScript configuration

- [tsconfig.base.json](tsconfig.base.json) — shared base (commonjs, ES2022, strict,
  `noUnusedLocals`, sourceMap). Created locally to replace the monorepo's missing
  `../tsconfig.base.json`.
- [tsconfig.json](tsconfig.json) — extension host. `types: ["node"]` **restricts** automatic
  type discovery, which is why `@types/vscode` is pulled in explicitly via `include` rather
  than through `typeRoots`. `vscode.proposed.externalUriOpener.d.ts` is included the same way.
- [preview-src/tsconfig.json](preview-src/tsconfig.json) — webview, `DOM` lib. **esbuild picks
  this tsconfig up automatically** based on the entry point's location; it does not need to be
  passed as a flag.

### esbuild

[esbuild.webview.mts](esbuild.webview.mts) is self-contained and runs directly (Node executes
`.mts` natively, no transpile step). Two of its options are mandatory and both are
non-obvious:

- `format: 'iife'` — the script is loaded by a plain `<script src>` **without**
  `type="module"`. An ESM bundle simply will not execute in the panel.
- `loader: { '.ttf': 'dataurl' }` — otherwise the icons do not render, because the CSP only
  allows `font-src data:`.

`minify` is on for production builds and off in watch mode; sourcemaps are always emitted.

### Proposed API

The manifest declares `enabledApiProposals: ["externalUriOpener", "browser"]` — the first for
`vscode.window.registerExternalUriOpener`, the second for the built-in browser and CDP (see
[the main approach](#how-we-build-features--the-main-approach)). Consequences:

- Both [vscode.proposed.externalUriOpener.d.ts](vscode.proposed.externalUriOpener.d.ts) and
  [vscode.proposed.browser.d.ts](vscode.proposed.browser.d.ts) are **checked into the repo** so
  the build works offline, and both are listed in `tsconfig.json`'s `include`. Refresh them
  with `npm run download-api`.
- Launching requires the `--enable-proposed-api=DenysDavydov.ai-browser` flag, which is set in
  [.vscode/launch.json](.vscode/launch.json). Without it, activation fails on
  `registerExternalUriOpener`.
- An extension using proposed API **cannot be published to the Marketplace** — it can only be
  distributed as a VSIX, or the code has to move to stable API.

### Debugging (F5)

[.vscode/launch.json](.vscode/launch.json) holds an `extensionHost` configuration. Its
`preLaunchTask` is the one-shot `npm: compile`, **deliberately not `watch`**: watch runs through
`run-p`, which prefixes output (`[watch-ext    ] ...`), so the standard `$tsc-watch` problem
matcher never recognises the tsc lines and the task hangs forever on "waiting for the build to
finish".

The working setup: `npm run watch` in a terminal for incremental rebuilds, plus F5 to
launch/relaunch the Extension Development Host.

## The `browser` proposed API — the main way to add features

`aiBrowser.useIntegratedBrowser` defaults to **true**: URLs open in VS Code's built-in browser,
and the webview panel is the opt-in path. The built-in browser is reachable from an extension
through the `browser` API proposal
([vscode.proposed.browser.d.ts](vscode.proposed.browser.d.ts), microsoft/vscode#300319):

- `window.browserTabs`, `window.activeBrowserTab`, `window.openBrowserTab(url)`, plus open /
  close / active-change / state-change events;
- `BrowserTab.startCDPSession()` — a full Chrome DevTools Protocol channel.

CDP is the important half. Reading the DOM, finding text, screenshots, evaluating script in
the page, element inspection — all of it is a CDP call, because that is exactly how the
built-in browser implements its own features.

Two things to know before writing against it, both handled by
[src/cdp.ts](src/cdp.ts):

- **The channel is browser-level**, the same shape as attaching to Chrome's browser websocket.
  Commands aimed at the page do nothing until you `Target.attachToTarget` (`flatten: true`)
  and pass the resulting `sessionId` on every message — `CDPClient.attachToPage()`.
- **`sendMessage` is fire-and-forget**, and every reply for every in-flight command arrives on
  one `onDidReceiveMessage`, so correlating by `id` is on us.

We declare two proposals now (`externalUriOpener`, `browser`). That does not change the
distribution story, which was already VSIX-only, but proposed APIs break without notice: if
the extension stops activating after a VS Code update, run `npm run download-api` and check
both `.d.ts` files.

### The activity bar panel

`contributes.viewsContainers.activitybar` adds an **AI Browser** container holding one view,
`aiBrowser.tools`, backed by [src/toolsView.ts](src/toolsView.ts). It is a `TreeDataProvider`
with three static rows, each carrying a `command` — not a webview. Three fixed rows need no
custom rendering, and a tree brings theming, keyboard navigation and accessibility for free
with no CSP or bundling involved. `media/activity-icon.svg` must stay a single flat
`currentColor` shape, because VS Code recolours activity bar icons.

`onView:aiBrowser.tools` is in `activationEvents`: without it the view renders empty until the
extension is activated by something else.

### The dropdown on the browser tab

One toolbar button on the browser tab opens a dropdown with all three element commands. It is
a `contributes.submenus` entry (`aiBrowser.elementMenu`) placed into `editor/title`;
`editor/title` allows submenus because `menusExtensionPoint.ts` leaves `supportsSubmenus` at
its default of `true`. **The `icon` on the submenu declaration is what makes it a toolbar
button** — without one it collapses into the tab's overflow menu.

**The element icons are custom SVGs, not codicons, and they have to be.** The three commands
use a crosshair with a coloured centre — red for Copy Element, green for XPath, blue for CSS
Path — from `media/icons/crosshair-{colour}-{light,dark}.svg`. A codicon could not do it: VS
Code renders codicons as font glyphs and recolours them, so any colour baked into one is lost.
A custom SVG is drawn as a `background-image` and keeps its own fills — but by the same token it
cannot inherit `currentColor`, which is why the ring and ticks ship as a light/dark pair while
the centre dot stays fixed. The activity bar container icon
(`media/activity-icon.svg`) is the opposite case and must stay a flat `currentColor` shape,
because that one *is* recoloured.

[src/toolsView.ts](src/toolsView.ts) points its `TreeItem.iconPath` at the very same files, so
the panel list and the browser tab cannot drift apart.

**The primary button is a faked split button.** VS Code has the real thing —
`isSplitButton: { togglePrimaryAction: true }` on a submenu item, rendered by
`DropdownWithDefaultActionViewItem`, which even persists the last action under
`${submenu.id}_lastActionId` — and the built-in browser uses it for its own "Add to Chat"
button. Extensions cannot: `menusExtensionPoint.ts` builds an extension's submenu item as
`{ submenu, icon, title, group, order, when }` and never sets that flag, and the manifest
schema accepts only `submenu` / `when` / `group`.

So instead: **three** primary buttons in `navigation@1`, each with a `when` on the
`aiBrowser.lastElementAction` context key, so exactly one is ever visible; the dropdown sits
beside them in `navigation@2` with a `$(chevron-down)` icon. [src/lastAction.ts](src/lastAction.ts)
keeps the context key and a memento in step — the memento because a context key does not
survive a restart. Each command records itself before running, in `extension.ts`.

`onStartupFinished` is in `activationEvents` **for this to work at all**: `when` clauses are
evaluated before activation, so without it the context key is unset on a fresh window and the
toolbar shows a lone chevron with no primary button. Two visually adjacent buttons is as close
as an extension gets — they are not fused into one control the way Run/Debug is.

**The `when` clause is the easy thing to get wrong.** It must be
`activeEditor == 'workbench.editor.browser'`. The `activeEditor` context key holds the *editor
(pane)* id — `BrowserEditorInput.EDITOR_ID`, i.e. `BrowserViewEditorId` from
`browserView.ts` — and **not** `workbench.editorinputs.browser`, which is
`BrowserEditorInput.ID`, the *input type* id. They sit two lines apart in
`browserEditorInput.ts`, and picking the wrong one produces a button that simply never appears,
with no error anywhere.

### The three element commands

All in [src/elementPicker.ts](src/elementPicker.ts), all sharing `withPickedElement`:

| Command | Output |
|---|---|
| `aiBrowser.copyElement` | the full Markdown context, matching the built-in browser's "Add Element to Chat" |
| `aiBrowser.copyElementXPath` | `//*[@id="main"]/span` or `/html/body/ul/li[2]` |
| `aiBrowser.copyElementCssPath` | `#main > div > li:nth-of-type(2)` |

The CSS path deliberately leaves classes out. Utility-class frameworks produce long, unstable
class lists, and a selector built from them reads worse and breaks sooner than a positional
one; the full class list is in "Copy Element" for anyone who wants it.

**Copy Element goes to the clipboard as text, and stays that way.** An attach-as-file route
was built and removed on request: it wrote the Markdown to `globalStorageUri` and passed the URI
to `workbench.action.chat.attachFile`. Do not rebuild it without being asked. Worth keeping from
that detour: **`vscode.env.clipboard` is text-only** — there is no API for putting a *file* on
the system clipboard, so "paste attaches a file" is unreachable without shelling out to the OS,
and `attachFile` accepts only `file` / `vscode-remote` / `untitled` URIs.

**Element picking is single-flight, and has to be.** Each pick opens its own CDP session and
turns on inspect mode. Two at once means a single click delivers
`Overlay.inspectNodeRequested` to *both* sessions, both commands run to completion, and the
later one overwrites the clipboard — which the user sees as "sometimes it copies an action I did
not choose". `pendingPick` in [src/elementPicker.ts](src/elementPicker.ts) cancels any pick
already in flight, so the latest choice wins. Related: clearing inspect mode belongs in
`finally`, because on cancellation the `await` throws and a statement placed after it never
runs — leaving the page stranded in picking state.

**The Markdown format is a port, not an invention.** `renderElementMarkdown` follows
`createElementContextValue` / `formatElementPath` from `browserEditorChatFeatures.ts`, and
`extractElementData` follows `extractNodeData` from `browserViewFrameInspector.ts`. The CSS
section — matched rules, `/* Inherited */`, `/* Resolved values */`, `/* CSS variables */`, the
`/*UA*/` marker — is produced by [src/cssHelpers.ts](src/cssHelpers.ts), which is upstream code
copied **verbatim** (616 lines, zero imports). That is what keeps our output identical to the
built-in browser's. Its upstream test suite came along as `src/cssHelpers.test.ts` and is its
specification; re-sync the two together rather than editing either in place.

The element itself is the **last** entry of `ancestors`, which is why `Element:` and the tail of
`HTML Path:` are always the same string.

### Element picker

`aiBrowser.copyElementXPath` ([src/elementPicker.ts](src/elementPicker.ts)) turns on
`Overlay.setInspectMode` — the same mechanism behind the built-in "Add Element to Chat", so
hover highlighting comes free — waits for `Overlay.inspectNodeRequested`, resolves the backend
node, and runs an XPath builder through `Runtime.callFunctionOn`. Inspect mode is switched off
before anything that can throw, or the page is left stuck in picking state.

The XPath builder prefers a **unique** `id` as its anchor and walks up only that far, and adds
a positional predicate only when a tag actually repeats among its siblings. Duplicate ids are
detected and rejected as anchors — anchoring on one would produce a path pointing at the wrong
element.

### Recipe for the next feature

1. Add the command to `contributes.commands` **and a matching `onCommand:` to
   `activationEvents`** — see the entry in
   [Things that break silently](#things-that-break-silently).
2. For a button on the browser tab, put it in the `aiBrowser.elementMenu` submenu (see
   [The dropdown on the browser tab](#the-dropdown-on-the-browser-tab)) rather than adding
   another `editor/title` entry — one dropdown beats a row of icons.
3. Guard twice, with different messages: `'browserTabs' in vscode.window` (proposal missing,
   or launched without the flag) and `vscode.window.activeBrowserTab` (nothing open). The
   fixes are unrelated, so one message would send people the wrong way.
4. `new CDPClient(await tab.startCDPSession())` → `attachToPage()` → `client.send(method,
   params, sessionId)`. Enable the domains you use (`DOM.enable`, `Overlay.enable`, …) first.
5. Undo anything that changes page state before any step that can throw, and
   `client.dispose()` in a `finally`.
6. Long interactions get `withProgress({ cancellable: true })`, with the token passed to
   `client.once(...)` so cancelling actually unblocks it.

Pure logic is worth testing outside VS Code — `npm test` needs no VS Code instance — but that
imposes a real constraint, learned the hard way:

**A module that `npm test` loads directly must have no relative *value* imports.** Node's type
stripping resolves neither an extensionless specifier nor a `.js` one to a `.ts` file, and the
`.ts` specifier that Node *does* accept is rejected by an emitting tsconfig. So test files use
explicit `.ts` imports and live in their own no-emit project
([tsconfig.test.json](tsconfig.test.json)); `tsconfig.json` excludes `**/*.test.ts` so they
never reach `out/` and never ship in the VSIX. This is why `elementMarkdown.ts` was split out
of `elementContext.ts` — the renderer is testable precisely because it imports nothing.
`import type` is fine anywhere; it is erased.

## Things that break silently

No compile error for any of these — they only surface at runtime.

1. **`format` other than `iife`** in esbuild → the panel script never runs, panel has no
   working controls.
2. **`.ttf` not loaded as `dataurl`** → CSP blocks the font, icons render as empty boxes.
3. **A `<script>` without a `nonce`** → blocked by CSP.
4. **`ai-browser-settings` id out of sync** between `aiBrowserView.ts` and
   `preview-src/index.ts` → `Could not load settings`, blank panel.
5. **`out/**` listed in [.vscodeignore](.vscodeignore)** → the VSIX builds but contains no
   extension code (`main` points into `out/`). The inherited `.vscodeignore` did exactly that,
   because the monorepo bundled into `dist/`. Fixed — do not reintroduce.
6. **A resource outside `media/`** → will not load; `localResourceRoots` only permits that
   directory.
7. **A command with no `onCommand:` activation event.** A `contributes.menus` button renders
   before the extension activates, so clicking it silently does nothing until the extension
   happens to be activated by something else — which makes it look like it works while you are
   developing. Implicit activation from `contributes.commands` needs `engines.vscode` at
   1.74 or later; every command here also gets an explicit `onCommand:` entry.
8. **Forgetting `npm run compile` after a clone** → `media/index.js` is not in git, panel is
   blank.

## Special cases and non-obvious decisions

The running log of quirks. **Append to this section whenever something turns out to be
non-obvious** — see [Conventions](#conventions). One entry per item: what it is, and why it is
that way, so nobody "cleans it up" and breaks it.

Several such decisions already have a natural home elsewhere in this file and are not repeated
here: the mandatory `iife` format and `.ttf → dataurl` loader are under
[esbuild](#esbuild), the CSP consequences under [Panel CSP](#panel-csp--the-main-constraint-when-extending),
the `preLaunchTask` choice under [Debugging (F5)](#debugging-f5), and the tsconfig `types`/`include`
interaction under [TypeScript configuration](#typescript-configuration).

- **`extension.ts` declares its own minimal `URL` class.** [src/extension.ts](src/extension.ts)
  has a local `declare class URL { … hostname: string }` instead of using a global. The base
  config's `lib` is `ES2022` only, with no `DOM`, so there is no ambient DOM `URL`. It is only
  used for `.hostname`, hence the two-member declaration. Removing it will not obviously fail
  in an editor that happens to resolve `URL` from `@types/node`, but it is load-bearing for the
  configured `lib`.

- **The IPv6 comment in `canOpenExternalUri` does not match the code.** The comment says "We
  have to replace the IPv6 hosts with IPv4 because URL can't handle IPv6", but nothing is
  replaced. What actually happens: `enabledHosts` contains the *bracketed* IPv6 forms
  (`[::1]`, `[::]`, …) because that is what `URL.hostname` returns for an IPv6 authority. The
  comment is stale; the bracket forms in the set are the real mechanism. Do not "simplify" them
  to bare `::1`.

- **`restore()` falls back to an empty URL.** `AIBrowserManager.restore()` does
  `state?.url ?? ''`, so a panel restored without serialized state navigates the iframe to an
  empty string. It is not a crash, but it looks like a blank browser rather than an error.

- **Text-grepping for a dependency name gives false negatives.**
  `@vscode/codicons` is referenced as `path.join(rootDir, 'node_modules', '@vscode', 'codicons', …)`
  in [esbuild.webview.mts](esbuild.webview.mts), so a `grep '@vscode/codicons'` finds nothing
  and the package looks unused. To audit dependencies, temporarily move the package out of
  `node_modules` and run `npm run compile && npm run typecheck` instead of trusting grep.

- **Node executes the build script directly.** `npm run build-webview` is plain
  `node ./esbuild.webview.mts` — Node 24 strips the types natively, so there is no transpile
  step and no build tooling for the build tooling. The consequence is that only erasable
  TypeScript syntax is allowed in that file: no `enum`, no `namespace`, and type-only imports
  must be written as `import type`.

- **`shouldUseIntegratedBrowser` defaults to the built-in browser.** All three entry points call
  `shouldUseIntegratedBrowser`, which originally returned `true` whenever the command
  `workbench.action.browser.open` existed. That command exists in every recent VS Code, so our
  own panel never opened at all and every change to it was invisible. It is now gated on
  `aiBrowser.useIntegratedBrowser`, which now defaults to **`true`** — the built-in browser is
  where features get built (see [the main approach](#how-we-build-features--the-main-approach)),
  and it is what the element picker attaches to. Setting it to `false` brings the panel back.

- **`preview-src/browserSearch.ts` is copied from microsoft/vscode** (MIT), from
  `src/vs/workbench/contrib/browserView/common/browserSearch.ts` at `1.134.0-1325-gaa7291eba7d`.
  It classifies address bar input as `url`/`query`/`unknown`/`empty` and builds search URLs.
  Three deliberate deviations from upstream, all recorded in the file header: `localize()` calls
  inlined as plain strings (no `vscode.l10n` inside the webview), `enum BrowserSearchEngineId`
  turned into a const object plus type alias, and an added exported `hasKnownScheme`.
  `preview-src/browserSearch.test.ts` is the upstream suite and, per upstream's own instruction
  in the header, *is the specification* — do not "fix" the parser to match Chromium more
  closely without updating it.

- **The copied enum had to go, because Node runs the tests.** `npm test` is
  `node --test preview-src/*.test.ts`, relying on Node 24's native type stripping — the same
  mechanism as `esbuild.webview.mts`. It only accepts erasable TypeScript, so an `enum` fails at
  runtime with `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_TYPESCRIPT_SYNTAX`. Anything reachable from a `*.test.ts` is
  under the same restriction as the build script: no `enum`, no `namespace`, `import type` for
  type-only imports.

- **The test spells out `./browserSearch.ts` in its import.** Node's type stripping resolves
  neither a `.js` specifier nor an extensionless one to a `.ts` file. Hence
  `allowImportingTsExtensions` in `preview-src/tsconfig.json`: without it `tsc --noEmit` rejects
  the exact import Node requires. Same reason the test uses
  `import * as assert from 'node:assert'` — a default import would need `esModuleInterop`,
  which the base config does not enable.

- **A scheme-less address gets `http` for localhost and `https` for everything else.**
  `addDefaultScheme` in `preview-src/index.ts` mirrors browser behaviour: a dev server on
  `localhost:3000` does not speak https, and localhost is what this extension mostly opens.
  Related trap — deciding "does this already have a scheme?" with a `^[a-z][a-z0-9+.-]*:`
  regex is wrong, because it also matches the host in `localhost:3000`. Use `hasKnownScheme`,
  which checks the prefix against the schemes the parser actually recognizes.

## Removed on purpose — do not reintroduce

- **The web/browser target** (`esbuild.browser.mts`, `tsconfig.browser.json`, the `browser`
  manifest field, the `*-web` scripts) — this extension is desktop-only. The `isWeb()` helper
  in `extension.ts` remains but always returns `false` on desktop.
- **gulp** — replaced by plain `tsc`. The old scripts referenced the monorepo's
  `../../build/gulpfile.extensions.mjs`.
- **`@vscode/extension-telemetry`** — was declared in `dependencies` but never imported
  anywhere in the code. No telemetry is sent.
- **`@types/vscode-webview`** — unused; `preview-src` declares its own `acquireVsCodeApi` with
  concrete types.
- **`contributes.menus.commandPalette` with `when: "isWeb"`** — once web support was dropped,
  this hid the command from the palette permanently. An entry without a `when` clause is
  redundant: commands from `contributes.commands` appear in the palette by default.

## Naming conventions

The `Simple Browser` → `AI Browser` rename follows these cases:

| Case | Used for |
|---|---|
| `AIBrowser` | Classes and types (`AIBrowserView`, `AIBrowserManager`, `AIBrowserSettings`) |
| `aiBrowser` | Command ids, settings section, `viewType`, activation events |
| `ai-browser` | Package `name`, DOM element id |
| `AI Browser` | User-visible strings (`displayName`, `category`, panel title) |

## Packaging a VSIX

`npm run package` → `ai-browser.vsix` (gitignored). `vscode:prepublish` runs the full
`compile` first, so the webview assets are always fresh in the package. `--no-dependencies` is
safe here precisely because there are no runtime dependencies.

Three things vsce insists on, each of which stopped the first attempt:

- **`@types/vscode` may not be newer than `engines.vscode`.** This is what forced
  `engines.vscode` to `^1.136.0`, and that is honest rather than a workaround: the `browser`
  API proposal only exists in recent VS Code, so the earlier `^1.74.0` was understating what
  the extension actually needs.
- **A `repository` field is required** as soon as the README has relative links (ours points
  at this file). Without it packaging fails outright; the alternative is passing
  `--baseContentUrl`, which is worse because it has to be repeated on every invocation.
- **`@vscode/vsce` pulls in two packages with blocked install scripts** (`@vscode/vsce-sign`,
  `keytar`) under the npm 11 `allowScripts` policy. Leave them blocked — they are only needed
  for `vsce publish`, and `package` works without them.

The root [LICENSE](LICENSE) is MIT and carries **both** copyright lines — Microsoft's, for the
forked and copied code, and the project's own. That is the honest form for this repository.
It does not replace the per-file `Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation … Licensed under the MIT
License` headers, which are still there on everything copied from vscode (`cssHelpers.ts`,
`browserSearch.ts`, the forked simple-browser sources). MIT requires that notice to travel with
the code, so **do not strip those headers** — the root LICENSE complements them rather than
standing in for them.

Because of the proposed APIs this VSIX **cannot go to the Marketplace**; install it with
"Extensions: Install from VSIX…", and note the extension only activates its browser features
on a VS Code new enough to carry the `browser` proposal.

## Known issues, not yet fixed

- **No linter.** It was covered by shared infrastructure in the monorepo. There are tests:
  `npm test` runs Node's own runner over `preview-src/*.test.ts`, no VS Code needed.
- **Zero production dependencies, and it is worth keeping it that way.** `build-ext` is `tsc`
  without bundling, so `out/` contains no dependencies. `vsce` will pack `dependencies` into
  the VSIX automatically, but once heavy runtime dependencies appear, the right move is to
  bundle the extension host with esbuild.
- **npm 11 blocks postinstall scripts.** `esbuild` has one, hence the `allowScripts` block in
  `package.json`. After an esbuild version bump the approval has to be granted again
  (`npm install-scripts approve esbuild`), otherwise the binary is not installed.
